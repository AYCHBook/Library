        pure Ruby library can read and write PNG images without depending on an external\n    image
        library, like RMagick. It tries to be memory efficient and reasonably fast.\n\n    It
        supports reading and writing all PNG variants that are defined in the specification,\n    with
        one limitation: only 8-bit color depth is supported. It supports all transparency,\n    interlacing
        and filtering options the PNG specifications allows. It can also read and\n    write
        textual metadata from PNG files. Low-level read/write access to PNG chunks
        is\n    also possible.\n\n    This library supports simple drawing on the
        image canvas and simple operations like\n    alpha composition and cropping.
        Finally, it can import from and export to RMagick for\n    interoperability.\n\n    Also,
        have a look at OilyPNG at http://github.com/wvanbergen/oily_png. OilyPNG is
